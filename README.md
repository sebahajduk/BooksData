# BooksData

This app allows user to find and save as favorite or buy book or audiobook. 
Books are read from JSON-type file and all informations about user are stored in Firebase.

BooksData is created only for learning purposes.

Milestones:
- Sign in / Sign up with Firebase Auth
- Saving user's favorites/bought books with Firestore
- User's profile editing (user can upload his own photo and create "About me" section)
- Custom TabBar and Picker
- Accessibility

App helps me with:
- Better understanding of property wrappers
- Learn how to store and read informations for already signed user
- Write cleaner code with SwiftUI
- Encapsulation in practice
